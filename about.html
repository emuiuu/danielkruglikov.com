        <p>Daniel Kruglikov comes from an immigrant family from former Soviet territories Ukraine and Russia. He grew up in the United States and graduated from New York University where he majored in Economics and European Studies. He went on to direct music videos for some of the biggest names in indie rock music, including Sean Lennon, The GOASTT, Soundwalk Collective and Patti Smith. He wrote and directed two short films, ‘Lula’, and ‘The Farewell’, which have screened at film festivals around the world.</p>
        <p>In 2017 he co-authored a feature documentary about Romani communities commissioned by ARTE and shot in seven countries across Eastern Europe. In 2019, he completed his first feature film 'Drita', which he wrote and directed. The film, shot in Kosovo, explores themes of vengeance and forgiveness. Executive-produced by Steve McQueen, Drita won prizes at film festivals globally.</p>
        <p>In 2021, he premiered 'Kilometer 4', a 12-minute video art piece shot in Somalia at Cannes Film Festival. That same year, he directed Offenbach’s opera 'Les Contes d’Hoffman' at Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. The production, set in a mental institution, premiered just before the invasion of Ukraine and won St. Petersburg’s highest theatrical honor.</p>
